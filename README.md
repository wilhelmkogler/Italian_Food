    <p align="justify">After the hero section, where users can browse through images with overlayed texts, the most popular dishes are presented in small, eye-catching cards designed to spark users' interest ‚Äì or even their appetite. <br><br> Below that, the restaurant‚Äôs full menu is displayed, allowing users to browse the available items even before arriving at the location ‚Äì perfect for checking it out on the way.</p>

    <img src="public/img/git3.JPG" alt="" srcset="">    
    <p align="justify">The next section is the 'Story', featuring a short background about the restaurant. This is followed by the restaurant‚Äôs opening hours and contact information, along with an integrated Google Map showing the exact location. At the bottom of every page, a minimalist footer provides quick and simple navigation.</p>
    <h2>Food Delivery</h2>
    <img src="public/img/git4.JPG" alt="" srcset="">
    <p align="justify">In this section, users can place delivery orders from the restaurant‚Äôs offerings. A category filter is available for faster browsing, and the food and drink items are displayed in compact cards. On larger screens, the cards are shown in multiple dynamic columns, while on smaller screens, they appear in one or two vertical columns ‚Äì all rendered dynamically from the MongoDB database.</p>
    <h2>Cart</h2>
    <img src="public/img/git3.png" alt="" srcset="">  
    <p align="justify">Items added to the cart appear in a vertically and horizontally centered cart interface, clearly displaying and summarizing the contents for the user. If the cart is empty, the user is informed accordingly. Users can also remove individual items from the cart if needed.</p>
    <h2>Checkout</h2>
    <img src="public/img/git7.JPG" alt="" srcset=""> 
    <p align="justify">After proceeding from the cart, users are presented with a checkout form where they must enter their personal details, including name, delivery address, and phone number. They can also choose between cash or card as their preferred payment method.</p>
    <h2>Placed Order</h2>
    <img src="public/img/git16.JPG" alt="" srcset="">
    <p align="justify">Once the required details are submitted, the order is successfully stored in the MongoDB orders collection. A SweetAlert popup then notifies the user whether the order was placed successfully or if an error occurred.</p>
    <h2>Admin Panel</h2>
    <img src="public/img/git9.JPG" alt="" srcset="">
    <p align="justify">Naturally, the restaurant has access to an admin panel where essential operations can be monitored and managed. This includes tracking orders and viewing statistics, as well as creating, editing, and deleting products.</p>
    <h2>Dashboard</h2>
    <img src="public/img/git10.jpg" alt="" srcset="">
    <p align="justify">The admin dashboard provides access to key and insightful statistics, such as the total number of orders, overall revenue, average cart value, and the most popular food and drink items. <br><br>        In addition, a pie chart displays the ratio between card and cash payments, while a revenue-over-time chart shows daily income trends‚Äîhelping identify which days are the most profitable and offering a clear overview of weekly popularity patterns.</p>
    <h2>Products</h2>
    <img src="public/img/git11.jpg" alt="" srcset="">
    <p align="justify">In the Products section, all records stored in the database are dynamically listed in a card-based layout similar to the Delivery section. A category filter is also available here, allowing users to browse items by type ‚Äì such as pizzas, pastas, and drinks.</p>
    <h2>Add, Edit & Delete</h2>
    <img src="public/img/git1.png" alt="" srcset="">
    <p align="justify">In the Admin Panel, records can be added, edited, or deleted directly from the table. By clicking the corresponding buttons, dedicated interfaces appear for each action. When adding or editing a record, a small form is displayed‚Äîcentered both vertically and horizontally‚Äîallowing the admin to input or update the necessary data.</p>
    <h2>Popup Messages</h2>
    <img src="public/img/git2.png" alt="" srcset="">
    <p align="justify">If the user submits incomplete or invalid data, a SweetAlert popup appears to alert them and prompt correction. When attempting to delete an existing product from the list, an interactive confirmation dialog is also shown to ensure the action is intentional.</p>
    <h2>Orders</h2>
    <img src="public/img/git15.jpg" alt="" srcset="">
    <p align="justify">The final feature is the Received Orders, where all customer orders are displayed for the restaurant to prepare and deliver. Alongside the ordered food and drinks, the interface also shows the customer's details, the total amount to be paid, and the elapsed time since the order was placed.</p>
    <h2>Responsive Design</h2>
    <img src="public/img/git4.png" alt="" srcset="">
    <p align="justify">To conclude, all pages and features have been built with full responsiveness in mind, ensuring accessibility across all smart devices. Most components are arranged in a vertical layout for optimal mobile viewing, and the navigation bar transforms into a collapsible menu accessible from the top-right corner.</p>
